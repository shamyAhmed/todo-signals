# Todo Signals

This project is a learning project, it is supposed to be testing angular's signals, while also testing some the signal approach of passing data between the children and the parent component.

# Todos

- [ ] Use `model` and `input` to pass data around.
- [ ] Add the delete functionality allowing the user to delete todos.
- [ ] incorporate indexDB web API to store structured data seamlessly.
- [ ] Allow the user to track when each task is created.
- [ ] Add groups/tags to allow users to organize their todos into groups, also providing the possibility of adding filters later in the project.
- [ ] Allowing the user to adjust the status of each todo task => 
    - Todo
